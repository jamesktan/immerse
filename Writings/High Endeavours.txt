Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|section|6|“I desire for you eternal success and prosperity and beg perfect...”
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|7|To the Assemblies and Meetings of the believers of God and the maidservants of the Merciful in the United States and Canada. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|8|Upon them be Bahá’u’lláh El’ Abhá 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|9|He is God! 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|10|O ye blessed souls: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|11|I desire for you eternal success and prosperity and beg perfect confirmation for each one in the divine world. My hope for you is that each one may shine forth like unto the morning star from the horizon of the world and in this garden of God become a blessed tree, producing everlasting fruits and results. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|12|Therefore I direct you to that which is conducive to your heavenly confirmation and illumination in the Kingdom of God! 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|13|It is this: Alaska is a vast country; although one of the maidservants of the Merciful has hastened to those parts, serving as a librarian in the Public Library, and according to her ability is not failing in teaching the Cause, yet the call of the Kingdom of God is not yet raised through that spacious territory. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|14|His Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God. Hence the mercy of God must encompass all humanity. Therefore do ye not think it permissible to leave that region deprived of the breezes of the Morn of Guidance. Consequently, strive as far as ye are able to send to those parts fluent speakers, who are detached from aught else save God, attracted with the fragrances of God, and sanctified and purified from all desires and temptations. Their sustenance and food must consist of the teachings of God. First they must themselves live in accordance with those principles, then guide the people. Perchance, God willing, the lights of the most great guidance may illumine that country and the breezes of the rose garden of the love of God may perfume the nostrils of the inhabitants of Alaska. Should ye become confirmed in thus rendering such a service, rest ye assured that ye shall crown your heads with the diadem of everlasting sovereignty and at the threshold of oneness you will become the favored and accepted servants.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|16|O Thou Incomparable God! O Thou Lord of the Kingdom! These souls are Thy heavenly army. Assist them and with the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse, make them victorious; so that each one of them may become like unto a regiment and conquer these countries through the love of God and the illumination of divine teachings. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|17|O God! Be Thou their supporter and their helper, and in the wilderness, the mountain, the valley, the forests, the prairies and the seas, be Thou their confidant—so that they may cry out through the power of the Kingdom and the breath of the Holy Spirit! 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|18|Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty and the Omnipotent and Thou art the Wise, the Hearing, and the Seeing.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|21|Letters to Individuals, 1939–1943. These were written prior to the formation of the first Local Spiritual Assembly and reflect the early development of the Faith in Alaska. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|section|22|(1) March 12, 1939
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|23|[1] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|24|Dear Bahá’í Friend, 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|25|The Guardian has received your most welcome and inspiring message of the 19th February, and is inexpressibly delighted to know that you have spontaneously offered your services for pioneer teaching in Alaska.[2] He can well imagine the feelings of immeasurable satisfaction and unbounded gratitude with which both the N.S.A. and the National Teaching Committee must have welcomed your determination to teach and establish the Faith in that far-off and hitherto unexplored territory, and he wishes me to express also his own appreciation and gratitude for this remarkable step which you have, notwithstanding the well-nigh insuperable obstacles in your way, been inspired to take to carry the Message to that distant land. The spirit of heroic self-sacrifice, and of unflinching resolve that has prompted you to undertake so noble and sacred a mission, and make such a warm and immediate response to his recent teaching call addressed to the American believers cannot but fill all hearts with admiration and praise, and evoke the memory of those acts of unrivalled heroism, of selfless and unstinted devotion that have characterized the lives of the immortal heroes of the Apostolic age of our beloved Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|26|Though labouring in an age and under circumstances wholly different from those in which those early pioneers of the Cause have been privileged to labour, yet it is that selfsame spirit of entire self-forgetfulness, of whole-hearted and unwavering loyalty, and of absolute consecration that is now, in this Formative period, inspiring you, and all our dear American Bahá’í pioneers, to forsake their all and undergo such privations and suffering in order to speed up and ensure the triumph of the Cause of God. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|27|Rest assured that the Guardian will incessantly and most fervently supplicate on your behalf, that the invisible hosts of the Kingdom may continually reinforce and guide your efforts, and enable you to attain this assuredly high and noble goal you have set yourself to attain in service to Bahá’u’lláh and His Cause. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|28|In the hope that this letter will find you well, happy and well on the way of the realization of your plans, and with most cordial greetings, 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|29|Yours ever in His Service,
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|30|H. Rabbani 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|31|[From the Guardian:] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|10|paragraph|32|Dear and prized co-worker: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|11|paragraph|33|I am thrilled by the news you give me. How proud I feel of the spirit that so powerfully animates you. My prayers will, I assure you, accompany you on your great and historic adventure. Persevere no matter how great the obstacles in your way. Future generations will glorify your deed and emulate your example. The Concourse on high acclaims your resolve and will richly bless your endeavours. Be happy and confident. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|12|paragraph|34|Your true brother,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|37|Dear Bahá’í Sister, 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|38|The Guardian has received your most welcome message of December 31st, and feels truly delighted to know of your recent confirmation in the Faith, and of the pioneer work you are now undertaking in Alaska,[3] in collaboration with our beloved sister Miss Honor Kempton. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|39|He is indeed grateful to you for having offered to teach and establish the Cause in that far off land, and feels confident that through the promised confirmations of Bahá’u’lláh and your own persistent efforts you will eventually succeed in completely attaining your goal. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|40|The various measures you have already taken with the view of giving widespread publicity to the Teachings have been noted with deep interest and appreciation by the Guardian who indeed trusts that they will result in attracting to the Cause people of capacity and understanding. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|41|He would urge you and also dear Miss Kempton to persevere, and through your joint exertions endeavour to pave the way for the formation of a local assembly in Alaska. Rest assured his prayers will be specially offered on behalf of you both, that you may receive ever-increasing strength, capacity and guidance to carry out your high teaching mission to complete success. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|42|With the renewed expression of his abiding gratitude for your devoted services, and with loving greetings, 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|43|Yours very sincerely,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|45|[From the Guardian:] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|10|paragraph|46|Dear and valued co-worker: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|11|paragraph|47|Your letter cheered and heartened me in the conduct of my arduous duties and responsibilities. I rejoice to learn of your high endeavours in that distant field, and I will specially pray with increasing fervour for your protection and success. How great your privilege, how laborious your task, how noble your mission! Do not feel disheartened. Persevere and be confident always. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|12|paragraph|48|Your true and grateful brother,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|section|50|(3) February 13th, 1940 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|51|Dear Bahá’í Sister, 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|52|The Guardian has received your most welcome communication of the 31st December, and his heart was greatly cheered and refreshed by the perusal of its contents, and at the evidences of the slow yet steady progress of your teaching work in Alaska. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|53|The very illuminating report you had given him covering the general social and religious conditions prevailing in that land clearly reveals the nature and extent of the obstacles which you have to face and surmount in the prosecution of your teaching task. But surely for such valiant and steadfast pioneers like you there is no difficulty, however seemingly insurmountable, which cannot be effectively overcome, as Bahá’u’lláh is assuredly guiding and reinforcing your labours through the unseen hosts of His Kingdom. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|54|The Guardian was particularly encouraged to know of the contact you have established with the editor of the “Alaskan,” and of his very generous offer to publish in his paper various materials on the Teachings. His hope is that this will prove a most effective medium for the spread of the Cause, and will bring in a large number of earnest inquirers. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|55|Also the Guardian cherishes very bright hopes regarding the bookshop which you have opened in Anchorage, which he trusts will serve to attract widespread attention to the Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|56|Renewing to you his abiding and heartfelt gratitude for your invaluable teaching services, and assuring you again of his continued prayers for the confirmation of your efforts, and also for your own welfare and protection in these dark and gloomy days, 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|57|Yours in His Service,
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|58|H. Rabbani 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|59|[From the Guardian:] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|10|paragraph|60|Dear and valued co-worker: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|11|paragraph|61|Your most welcome report brought immense joy to my heart. With feelings of increasing pride, admiration and gratitude I follow your activities and pray continually for your success. Do not relax in your efforts. The Concourse on high is watching over you and the Blessed Beauty will reinforce and guide you. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|12|paragraph|62|Your true and grateful brother,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|section|64|(4) December 12th, 1942
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|65|Dear Bahá’í Sister, 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|66|Your letter of Aug. 5th has been received, and the Guardian was very pleased to hear from you. He has instructed me to write and answer you on his behalf, and also thank you for the photographs you enclosed. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|67|He feels that this is a very important opportunity which you have now obtained of teaching the Faith to the Eskimo people,[4] and he hopes your efforts will be crowned with success. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|68|He would not advise you to teach them Esperanto, as we have no way of knowing whether it will ultimately be chosen as the auxiliary language of the world. He thinks the most direct and quickest way of communicating with them in a common tongue should be chosen; in other words either you should learn their language or they yours, whichever will yield the quickest results. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|69|As they are a relatively uncivilized people, unused to the modern cosmopolitan forms of life, and consequently not au courant with the thoughts which to us have become mere commonplace, he would advise you to approach them through love, friendliness, and association, until you are in a position to enter into their confidence, and gradually teach them, in a simple way, the great truths of our Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|70|To confirm them in the Faith should be your main objective, always bearing in mind that faith and belief are different from learning and a full grasp of the implications of such a vast Cause as ours. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|71|You may be sure his loving prayers will be offered for the success of your historic mission, and he will be interested to hear how you are progressing. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|72|With Bahá’í love,
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|73|R. Rabbani 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|10|paragraph|74|[From the Guardian:] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|11|paragraph|75|Assuring you of my abiding gratitude and appreciation for the magnificent services you are rendering, and for the laudable spirit you are demonstrating in your historic activities and achievements in these days of stress and peril, and assuring you also of my special and constant prayers for the success of every effort you exert, and every step you take in the path of service, 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|12|paragraph|76|Your true and grateful brother,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|section|78|(5) July 24th, 1943 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|79|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|80|The Guardian was very happy to receive your letter of May 29th; and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|81|It is with great joy that he welcomes you into the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, and he hopes that you will be the means of attracting many other souls to this glorious life-giving Message. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|82|‘Abdul-Bahá was most anxious that the Eskimo people should be taught the Message of this New Day, and it is a source of happiness to all Bahá’ís that you, a member of that race, have arisen to spread these teachings.[5] God has surely guided your steps and blessed your search for divine Truth. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|83|If people only realized it, the inner life of the spirit is that which counts, but they are so blinded by desires and so misled that they have brought upon themselves all the suffering we see at present in the world. The Bahá’ís seek to lead people back to a knowledge of their true selves and the purpose for which they were created, and thus to their greatest happiness and highest good. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|84|You may be sure the Guardian will pray that you may render the Cause many valuable services and become a gifted and confirmed Bahá’í teacher. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|85|With warm Bahá’í love,
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|86|R. Rabbani 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|87|P.S. It will interest you to know that there are now Bahá’ís active in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and the Eskimo village of Tuluksak, Alaska. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|10|paragraph|88|[From the Guardian:] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|11|paragraph|89|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|12|paragraph|90|Your most welcome letter has rejoiced my heart. I extend to you a most hearty welcome into the ranks of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh, and will greatly value your support and cooperation. Your conversion to His Cause is indeed a historic event, and will greatly rejoice the hearts of the believers. I will pray for your success and spiritual advancement from the depths of my heart. Rest assured and be confident. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|13|paragraph|91|Your true brother,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|94|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|95|Your letter of July 9th has reached the Guardian safely, and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|96|He feels that the most important thing at the present time is, of course, the establishment of the first Bahá’í Spiritual Assembly of Alaska. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|97|He hopes that, after the assembly is well established and has a sufficient number to maintain its status, you will again be able to do pioneer teaching work among the Eskimos. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|98|Your talk on the Faith in the church of Tuluksak may, indeed, have reached some of them, and left a seed of Truth in their minds. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|99|As the Centenary Celebration of the Faith draws near the Guardian finds himself busier than ever before and barely able to keep pace with his work. However, his thoughts are often with the friends, and he is very proud of their achievements. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|100|He assures you of his deep appreciation of your devoted and self-sacrificing services, and that his loving prayers will continue to be offered on your behalf.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|12|paragraph|105|I admire and feel proud of your historic achievements. I am deeply grateful to you and will continue to pray from the depths of my heart for your protection, happiness, and the speedy and full realization of every hope you cherish in such an important sphere of Bahá’í activity.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|111|Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Anchorage 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|112|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|113|Your letter of Aug. 6th brought great joy to the Guardian’s heart. It has taken it some time to reach him but he has instructed me to answer it at once. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|114|He was particularly pleased to hear of the weekly radio broadcasts you are giving, and feels that this cannot but have a marked effect on the progress of the Cause in Alaska, both visibly and spiritually. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|115|Although there are many souls ripe to receive the message, there are many others who, though they are not able to recognize its import at present, will take the seed into their hearts, and there it will ultimately germinate. Radio reaches so many people and thus is of the utmost importance. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|116|It was very kind of you to think of sending gifts to the Guardian made by Eskimos, and he will value them as tokens of your love and the handiwork of a people whom he is most anxious should receive the Divine Message. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|117|He hopes that your Assembly will endeavour to reach the Eskimos with the Message; he fully realizes how difficult a task this is, but it is also one of great importance. If but one of these souls should become truly enkindled, he or she could then teach others in their own language and a manner suited to their minds. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|118|Assuring you all of the loving appreciation of your devoted services, and his ardent prayers for the success of your labours.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|13|paragraph|123|It is always a joy to hear from you.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|128|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|129|Your letter of December 3rd has reached the beloved Guardian; and he was very pleased to receive the assurance of your determination to persevere in the work of the Cause, and achieve all the goals set before the American Bahá’í Community. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|130|He was also very happy indeed to know that all Alaskan Bahá’ís had been present. He considers this a great achievement. When we consider that not so many years ago, there was not a single Bahá’í in Alaska, we can truly say: “What hath God wrought!”—and with thankful hearts rededicate ourselves to the work of His Faith.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|140|Our beloved Guardian has received your letter of January 17th, enclosing the loving contribution for the Shrine of the Báb from the Bahá’ís of the Anchorage District; and has instructed me to answer on his behalf, and to send you the attached receipt. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|141|He very deeply appreciates your gift toward the completion of this most holy enterprise, which is serving to draw the devoted believers in all lands closer to the Center of their Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|142|Naturally he is most happy to hear of the growth of the Faith in your land, and it cannot be otherwise when there is such firm resolve and determination to serve, and such harmony among the devoted believers.

He has asked me to acknowledge receipt of your letter on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|154|The Guardian feels that the four forthcoming Conferences are the most important gatherings ever held in the Faith to date. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|155|The Conferences will bring together representatives of the entire Bahá’í World, representing twelve national communities, made up of numerous racial and religious backgrounds. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|156|The purpose of the Conferences will be the world-wide propagation of the Faith. They will lay the foundations of the service of the Bahá’ís of the world for the great ten year Crusade ahead—which, God willing, will be consummated in the fulfillment of the prophecies of Daniel, and the achievement of the initial goals set by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, whereby the world will be flooded with the Glory of the Lord. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|157|The Guardian attaches great importance to the Conference to be held in Wilmette, and he sincerely hopes as many of the believers as possible will attend. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|158|The Guardian will pray at the Shrines for the friends in Anchorage.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|165|Just a little note to assure you our beloved Guardian received your Naw-Rúz greeting, which he appreciated very much. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|166|Great things lie ahead of the Bahá’ís in Alaska, and he will pray that they may attain their goals speedily and worthily.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|171|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|172|Your loving letter of January 23rd has been received by the Beloved Guardian, and he has directed me to acknowledge it in his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|173|The Guardian feels the Dedication of the Temple, and the Intercontinental Teaching Conference to be held immediately thereafter, will mark a most important historic milepost in the development of the Faith in America, and the world. It will close the epoch of Temple Building, and open the 10 year period of World Crusade, during which time, the Faith will be established over the face of the earth. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|174|The Guardian is happy Rúhíyyih Khánum and Vice-President Collins of the International Bahá’í Council can attend to represent him. He hopes as many of the Friends as possible will be present.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|181|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|182|The Beloved Guardian has asked me to write the Friends of Alaska on his behalf, and explain to them that he is following very closely their activities in Alaska. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|183|He attaches the very greatest importance to the services which are being rendered by the Bahá’ís in that land. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|184|The future of Alaska is so important that he has set as one of the goals of the Ten Year Crusade, the establishment of a National Spiritual Assembly in Alaska, notwithstanding its present or future political relationship with the United States. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|185|This great gift which has come to Alaska likewise calls for great sacrifice and service. The Guardian feels the Bahá’ís of Alaska fully realize the heavy responsibilities devolving upon them and will arise with a superhuman effort to spread the Faith throughout the length and breadth of the country. He will welcome advice of the opening up of new cities and centers throughout Alaska, which will lay the foundation stones on which the future National Assembly can be built. The only way this can be done is for the Friends to “scatter” as the Master foretold, and settle in new cities, areas, etc. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|186|A copy of this letter is being sent to the American National Spiritual Assembly, so that they might assist the friends of Alaska to fulfill their spiritual mission and help their country attain its spiritual destiny. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|187|Please send a copy of this appeal of the Guardian to each Believer in Alaska. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|188|The Beloved Guardian sends his loving greetings to each and every one of the Bahá’ís in Alaska. He assures you of his prayers at the Holy Shrine in your behalf, that every obstacle may be removed from your paths, as you prosecute this sacred mission.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|194|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|195|The beloved Guardian has asked me to write you on his behalf, concerning settlement in Kotzebue, in the Arctic Circle. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|196|He has learned that one of the Bahá’ís of Anchorage, or Alaska, has gone or is going soon to Kotzebue, and he wishes full information in connection therewith. He would like to know who the pioneer is, when he settled, or if not settled, when he will do so. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|197|The Guardian attaches the greatest importance to this project, and he asks that your Assembly assist the pioneer in every way possible. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|198|The Guardian asks that you give his love to the pioneer either in or enroute to Kotzebue, and assure him, the Guardian will pray for him; that the Divine Confirmations may be with him, that every obstacle may be removed from his path, and that he will achieve new victories for our Glorious Faith.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|204|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|205|Your letter of September 3rd has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|206|The Bahá’ís of Alaska have always proved themselves full of initiative and devotion; and he feels sure that they will successfully accomplish their goal of having an independent National Assembly before the end of the ten years. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|207|He feels that if Mrs. Wells can go to Kotzebue next Spring, it would be excellent. The ideal of course is for the friends to obtain work before they go to new places, if at all possible, and in this way not deplete their resources or be a burden on the Fund. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|208|The Guardian was also very happy to hear that the Caldwells are still in the Aleutian chain, as he attaches the greatest importance to this very difficult post. He urges your Assembly to give them all the encouragement you can, and to impress upon them the importance of remaining there. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|209|You may be sure he will pray for the progress of your work in the holy Shrines; and no doubt the National Assembly will give you every assistance it can. As you know, it has heavy demands made upon it at present, in order to get the pioneers out to their posts; and the consolidation work will undoubtedly be taken up later on. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|210|With warmest Bahá’í greetings to you all,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|218|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|219|The beloved Guardian is following very closely the activities in connection with the Ten-Year Crusade throughout the entire Bahá’í world. He has been encouraged by the reports reaching him from all centers. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|220|The Guardian is happy over the development of the Faith in Alaska. Inasmuch as one of the very important goals of the Ten Year Crusade is the establishment of a National Spiritual Assembly for Alaska, the Guardian is hopeful that the friends will very seriously undertake the establishment of the Faith in the important cities, and the development of as many assemblies as possible. This can be accomplished best, of course, by “scattering” from the larger communities, and in settling in new areas. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|221|The beloved Guardian was greatly encouraged to learn through a letter from Mr. and Mrs. Caldwell addressed to me, that at the Alaska State Convention on December 6th, a fund was started for the Hazíratu’l-Quds. The Guardian attaches great importance to the development of the Hazíratu’l-Quds even before there are prospects for the establishment of the National Assembly. The Guardian is arranging for a gift to this fund of $500 as his personal contribution. It will be sent you by the Treasurer of the American N.S.A. He hopes this will stimulate the friends to contribute to this important fund, as time goes on. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|222|The beloved Guardian sends his loving greetings to all the friends in Alaska.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|230|Your letter of April 6th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|231|In regard to the matters you raised in it, he feels that the Hazíratu’l-Quds should be inside the city limits. Ten miles from the town is too far out to be practical.[6] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|232|The first thing is to acquire, if possible, either a building site or a building; but pending the possibility of doing this, which no doubt will involve considerable expenditure, he advises you to go on augmenting the Hazíratu’l-Quds Fund. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|233|He would like you to please forward him a list of all the places where there are Bahá’ís throughout Alaskan territory, specifying whether it is an Assembly, a Group or an isolated Centre. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|234|Although he attaches great importance to the opening of new Centres throughout any territory, including, of course, Alaska, he wishes you to give special attention to sending a pioneer to Point Barrow, beyond the Arctic Circle. He feels that there is a great significance in having believers serving so far north; and he hopes that one of the friends will be able to secure some employment there and proceed to act as a pioneer in this highly meritorious field. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|235|All the news that you gave him was good news, and he appreciated it deeply. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|236|You may be sure that his loving prayers will surround you and all the friends, as they labour to carry the Faith throughout Alaskan territory, and to hasten the day when it will have its own independent National Spiritual Assembly.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|259|Your letter of June 25, 1954, with enclosure, has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|260|He was indeed happy to learn that, through the dispersal of the friends in Anchorage to three other cities, the goal set by the Alaska Teaching Committee for the last year was achieved. This is indeed most encouraging news. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|261|The rapid expansion of the Faith in Alaska has delighted the heart of the Guardian. The way the believers have scattered in order to create new Centers, shows their great devotion and courage. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|262|He is now looking forward to the time when the friends there will have their own Hazíratu’l-Quds. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|263|Please convey the loving greetings of the Guardian to all the Alaska Bahá’ís; and assure them of his deep appreciation of their sacrificial services, and their determination to broaden the basis of their Faith in that country.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|274|Your letter of April 6th with enclosures has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|275|The contribution you enclosed from the Bahá’ís of Anchorage Recording District is greatly appreciated. Receipt is enclosed herewith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|276|The Guardian greatly appreciated receiving the incorporation papers from the Anchorage District Assembly. He feels the incorporation of this Assembly an historical event. He likewise appreciates the map which you sent showing the area involved in the recording district, as well as the location of the Bahá’í property. So far as the use of the land is concerned, this is something which will have to be determined as time goes on, and particularly when Alaska establishes their National Assembly. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|277|The Guardian sincerely hopes all the friends in Alaska will redouble their teaching efforts, so that the Faith may become firmly established. The work of the Alaska Bahá’ís has so encouraged the Guardian that he has announced the formation of the National Spiritual Assembly for Alaska in 1957. It is evident that intensive teaching work must be done between now and that date, so that there will be a sufficient number of Assemblies and a wide enough basis of the Faith throughout Alaska to build up a proper foundation for this crowning institution. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|278|The challenge has now come to the Alaska Bahá’ís. We all hope and pray they will be assisted in their strenuous efforts.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|457|I welcome, with joy, pride and thankfulness, the convocation, on the northern fringes of the Western Hemisphere, and in a region that must needs play a prominent part in the shaping of the destinies of mankind, of the first Alaskan Bahá’í Convention. So auspicious an event constitutes an important milestone in the progressive unfoldment of the Bahá’í World Spiritual Crusade, and represents the fruition of the valiant efforts exerted, in the course of several decades, by the American Bahá’í Community, which has striven so steadfastly to ensure the emergence of independent Bahá’í Communities in that hemisphere. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|458|So great a triumph, crowning so much patient and painstaking labour, won at the hour when the Bahá’í World Spiritual Crusade is entering the second year of the third phase in its irresistible unfoldment, must be celebrated through the initiation of a subsidiary Six-Year Plan on the part of the newly-formed Alaskan National Spiritual Assembly, for the purpose of speedily increasing the number of the followers of the Faith; of multiplying its Centres; of adding to its existing Local Spiritual Assemblies; of inaugurating a National Bahá’í Fund; of establishing a Summer School; of initiating local Bahá’í endowments; of incorporating the newly-emerged National Spiritual Assembly as well as all firmly grounded local spiritual assemblies; of obtaining recognition for the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate, as well as the Holy Days on which work is forbidden; of stimulating the conversion of both the Eskimos and American Indians, and of purchasing a plot of land to serve as the site for the future Mashriqu’l-Adhkár of Alaska. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|459|I appeal to the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly to persevere in their highly laudable endeavours on behalf of a Community so small yet so valiant and promising, and to ensure by every means in their power the steady development and consolidation of the institutions of an Order to whose rise and establishment they have so conspicuously contributed. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|460|May the process now set in motion gather momentum in the years lying ahead, through a liberal effusion of the grace of Bahá’u’lláh, and may those whose privilege it is to stimulate its development, be guided in every step they take, and fulfill every desire they cherish for its ultimate consummation.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|494|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|495|Your loving letter of May 15th was received by the Beloved Guardian and he has directed me to acknowledge it in his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|496|The contribution made by the friends in Ketchikan to the International Fund is greatly appreciated. Receipt is enclosed. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|497|The establishment of the new National Spiritual Assembly in Alaska must be a source of great gratification to those of you who have labored so long and diligently in the establishment of the Faith in that very important country. This great blessing likewise carries with it many serious responsibilities. The greatest responsibility today is the diffusion of the Divine Fragrances and the establishment of the Faith far and wide. The Guardian hopes therefore that the Members of your Assembly will arise with renewed vigor and not only spread the Faith more firmly in Ketchikan, but will spread your energies to surrounding areas so that new lights of Divine Guidance may be established in the various centers. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|498|The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf. He sends you his loving greetings. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|499|Faithfully yours,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|502|National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Alaska 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|503|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|504|The beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer the letters received, with enclosure, from the Assembly’s Recording Secretary and from the Secretary, and dated as follows: May 4, 7, 29 and June 11. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|505|He is very happy to see the eagerness with which this new historic Body has embarked upon its tasks, and he wishes you to know that he is particularly pleased with the Alaska Community. He admires the lively spirit animating it and which indeed has animated it for years—the spirit of optimism and joyous service, and its determination and courage. He has recently heard many fine things about the friends there and the work they are doing from Mrs. Florence Mayberry, all of which have encouraged him to cherish the very highest hopes for the future of the work in that vast territory. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|506|He hopes your Assembly will devote special, constant attention to encouraging the friends in their teaching work, and facilitate their tasks. As the new National Assemblies are being formed, he feels it incumbent upon him to issue a word of warning to avoid rules and regulations and tying the believers’ work up in red tape. Over-administration can be even worse for the Faith at this time than under-administration. The believers are, for the most part, young in the Cause, and if they make mistakes it is not half as important as if their spirit is crushed by being told all the time—do this and don’t do that! The new National Body should be like a loving parent, watching over and helping its children, and not like a stern judge, waiting for an opportunity to display his judicial powers. The reason he points this out to you is that constantly, for the past twenty years and more, he has been pointing this out to the old and tried National Assemblies, and he does not want the younger bodies to make the same mistakes. Individual cases should be dealt with as they arise, according to the Teachings, of which the believers have quite sufficient available to handle all of their problems at this time, and no more additional rules and regulations need be introduced. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|507|The friends should be helped to overcome their problems, deepen in the Faith, and increase their unity and their love for each other. In this way you will find that your work goes ahead speedily, and that the National Body is like the beating of a healthy heart in the midst of the Community, pumping spiritual love, energy and encouragement out to all the members. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|508|As regards the question you asked about a Summer School, there is no reason why a property should either be rented or bought for this purpose. You can arrange to hold a Summer School in any suitable place where the friends can find accommodation, and a hall can be rented for its sessions. This is what they have done in England for many years to great advantage. It is a simple and economical way of holding the School. The primary purpose of the School is to deepen the knowledge of the friends in the Teachings, to enable them to consort, as Bahá’ís, with each other, and to confirm any contacts who may have attended. The School may be held during the winter season or any other time of the year. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|509|As regards local endowments, these can be a piece of land, or a building offered or purchased in any place in Alaska. However, as the friends have six years in which to accomplish their Plan, and the most important work of all is the teaching work, he would not advise that they begin by spending their money on these projects, unless somebody has a piece of land or a building which they wish to give. The site for the Temple is much more important. It should be near the capital of Alaska within easy distance, or preferably in it, so that the friends can gather there, when the Temple is built for their services. If the twenty-acre National Endowment is suitably close to the city, it can be used as the Temple site, and another piece of land, smaller in area, and anywhere in Alaska, be acquired as the National Endowment. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|510|He is delighted to see that you are approaching your tasks with so much enthusiasm, and awaits news of wonderful victories from that promising northern territory. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|10|paragraph|511|He feels your Assembly should bear in mind, and call to the attention of the friends, the importance of the Iron Curtain territories not yet open. Whoever feels the urge to dedicate themselves to arising and going to one of the satellites or republics of the Soviet Union, should be encouraged to do so. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|11|paragraph|512|He hopes to receive much good news during the coming months of the progress of the work there, and assures you all of his prayers for your success. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|12|paragraph|513|With loving greetings,
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|13|paragraph|514|R. Rabbani 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|14|paragraph|515|[From the Guardian:] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|15|paragraph|516|Dear and valued co-workers: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|16|paragraph|517|The formation of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Alaska signalizes the erection of yet another pillar designed to support, and reinforce the foundation of the future Universal House of Justice, and marks a milestone of far reaching significance in the history of the evolution of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the North American continent. I rejoice at this remarkable evidence of the vitality of the Faith which animates the members of the small yet highly promising community of His followers in that far off northern region of the globe, a region destined to play an important role in shaping the spiritual destinies of the great Republic of the west of which it forms a part, and to contribute, in no small measure, to the establishment of the institutions of His World Order throughout the American continent. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|17|paragraph|518|The task now facing this highly promising, spiritually dynamic community, at the hour of its emergence as an independent member of the embryonic World Bahá’í Commonwealth, is truly formidable; the responsibilities which it valiantly shoulders, at this crucial hour in its evolution are sacred, heavy, manifold and inescapable. The tests and trials which it must, sooner or later, experience in the course of its unfoldment and consolidation will severely challenge its spirit and resources. The path which it must tread ere the full evidence of its latent capacities are manifested will be long, tortuous and stony. The indomitable faith which now so powerfully animates its members, however, will, beyond the shadow of a doubt, enable them to overcome whatever obstacles may confront them in the future, and ensure the ultimate attainment of their high destiny. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|18|paragraph|519|The Six Year Plan, to which this community is now committed, and which should be regarded as the chief and immediate instrument designed to ensure the triumphant conclusion of the initial stage in the unfoldment of its destiny, must be energetically prosecuted however great the sacrifices involved, and must receive the concentrated, the continuous and prayerful consideration of its national elected representatives. All must participate in furthering its interests and in ensuring its ultimate and complete success. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|19|paragraph|520|Every effort must be exerted to increase steadily the number of avowed adherents of the Faith in that Territory, to multiply its centres, to consolidate its local Assemblies, to incorporate the firmly grounded amongst them. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|20|paragraph|521|The establishment of Bahá’í endowments and of a summer-school, and the incorporation of the National Spiritual Assembly itself, must be simultaneously and efficiently carried out. Steps must likewise be taken to obtain recognition of the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate and of the Bahá’í Holy Days from the civil authorities concerned. Nor must the vital obligation of converting as speedily as possible, both the Eskimos and the American Indians, who, as time passes, must assume a notable share in the diffusion of the Faith and the establishment of its rising Order in these regions, be, under any circumstances neglected; and last but not least, the selection and purchase of a site for the Mother Temple of Alaska, in the city of Anchorage or its suburbs, must be carefully considered and suitable action taken at the earliest opportunity. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|21|paragraph|522|The endeavours which the highminded, youthful hearted, deeply consecrated members of this community will exert must be such as to excite the unqualified admiration of their fellow believers in Bahá’í communities in both Hemispheres. The sacrifices which must be made will, no doubt, if they rise to this occasion, merit the applause of the Concourse on high and draw forth a still fuller measure of the promised blessings of the Author of the Divine Plan Himself. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|22|paragraph|523|That the members of this community may neither falter nor fail, that they may set an example worthy of emulation of their fellow-workers in all continents of the globe, that they may achieve such feats, in the course of the attainment of their high objectives, as shall eclipse the past achievements of their spiritual brethren in the North American continent and throughout Latin America, is the object of my constant prayer for them in the Holy Shrines as well as my heart’s most cherished desire.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|527|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|528|Your loving letter of June 7th was duly received by the beloved Guardian and he has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf. The contribution which you have made to the International Fund is greatly appreciated. Receipt is enclosed. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|529|The Spirit of confirmation is descending in torrents on all those who arise to teach in a devoted and consecrated manner. Never before have so many victories been won in the teaching field as are being won all over the Bahá’í world at this time. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|530|Alaska has developed very remarkably in the past years. With the establishment of the new National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska in Ridván of this year, the Guardian is hopeful that the friends will arise with renewed effort and spread the Faith far and wide. A new spirit has been released due to the establishment of the National Assembly and the friends should seize their opportunity while they still have the chance and win many souls to the Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|531|The Guardian will pray for you and for the success of your work. He sends his loving greetings.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|537|Your letter of May 29th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|538|He is very happy to learn that your Assembly now has an endowment of its own. This will give the Faith a greater prestige and standing there. The spiritual vitality shown by the friends in Alaska pleases him greatly. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|539|Please express his appreciation of their gift to the Faith to the donors of this tract of land.[11]
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|540|He assures you of his prayers for you all, and for the rapid progress of the work in that region, and throughout Alaska.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|570|The Guardian feels that it is proper for your Assembly to make a contribution to the International Fund because it links more closely the activities of the National Assembly with the World Center of the Faith and through you all the Bahá’ís in Alaska. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|571|Alaska has won many great victories for the Faith in the past, but the Guardian feels sure now that the National Assembly has been established, the victories to be won in the future will be far more glorious and far more effective for the spread of the Faith.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|586|The Divine Confirmations are descending in torrents on those who arise to teach. At this critical time in the history of the Faith, teaching is the one Bahá’í service that is Confirmed. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|587|The Guardian hopes that you will therefore arise with renewed effort to take your part in this great crusade now sweeping the world. America has been called upon by the Master to play the preponderating role in this great World Crusade which is moving forward with increasing momentum.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|645|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|646|Your loving letter of October 1st was duly received by the beloved Guardian and he has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|647|The contribution which has been sent by your Assembly to the International Fund is greatly appreciated. Receipt is enclosed. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|648|The Guardian is happy that the friends in Alaska are arising with such vigor and enthusiasm to serve the Cause of God. They have won outstanding and historic victories for the Faith, but the thing that pleases him most is that each victory that is won has been used as a stepping stone to further service in the Cause of God. Thus the Cause is expanding very rapidly both in the teaching and administrative fields. He hopes that your Assembly will be guided and confirmed in the noble undertakings in which you are engaged. But he likewise hopes that you will be able to stimulate all the friends to intensive effort so that many seeking souls may find eternal life at this particular time and that the Institutions of the Faith may be firmly established in that promising Country. He will pray for you and for the success of your work. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|649|He sends you his loving greetings. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|650|Faithfully yours,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|653|Letters to Individuals, 1946–1957. These letters were addressed to many individuals who continued to write directly to the Holy Land after the formation of the institutions. The tone of the letters reflects personal interests rather than institutional development. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|section|654|(56) July 30, 1946 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|655|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|656|Your letter dated July 17th has been received, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|657|He was very pleased to hear the Alaskan believers are so active, and that you have witnessed with your own eyes such a wonderful development of the Faith there these last few years, since you went there as a pioneer. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|658|He was also delighted to hear Mr. Oliver is anxious to translate some of the Writings into Eskimo; please assure him this would be rendering both the Eskimos and the Cause a great service. If anything is printed in that language the Guardian would like to receive copies for the libraries here. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|659|He hopes through the “Arctic Trails Shopping Service” you will be able to demonstrate the fairness, uprightness, and nobility of the adherents of the Bahá’í Faith to the people it deals with, as this will more than anything else attract their attention to the Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|660|As to your own plans: if you are absolutely certain that your departure from Alaska will not in any way affect the stability of the Cause there, he approves of your suggestion that you go to Europe and assist the work there. If, on your way, you could visit and do some teaching in England it would help the British Bahá’ís very much, as they are embarking on a very heavy teaching schedule. He will pray that your family there may become attracted to the Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|661|Assuring you of his deep appreciation of your wonderful services and his loving prayers. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|662|Yours in the Faith,
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|663|R. Rabbani 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|10|paragraph|664|P.S.—If Mr. Oliver would begin by translating even a small pamphlet into Eskimo at once this would be a much appreciated service. Please send him some printed copies as soon as available. Please assure this dear friend that his service is highly meritorious. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|11|paragraph|665|[From the Guardian:] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|12|paragraph|666|Assuring you of my deepfelt and abiding gratitude for the splendid and historic services you have rendered our beloved Faith and of my constant prayers for the extension of your valued activities, and the realization of every hope you cherish for the advancement of its institutions, 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|13|paragraph|667|Your true and grateful brother,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|670|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|671|Your letter of January 9th has been received and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|672|He very much appreciated your desire to once again answer the call for pioneers and go to Europe, and in principle he approves of your doing so. However, Miss Kempton[13] has already left Alaska, and you say Miss Dole[14] is contemplating doing so, and he is very concerned lest the work in Alaska suffer and the number of resident believers in Anchorage fall to below Assembly status. Alaska is one of the prizes of the first Seven Year Plan, and must be guarded at all costs. If you find in the future, after consultation with the National Teaching Committee, that you can be safely spared from the work there, he approves of your going to Europe. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|673|He cannot suggest to you what form of employment would be best for you, but he will pray that you may be guided in this matter, and that your Bahá’í services be richly blessed. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|674|With loving greetings,
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|675|R. Rabbani 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|676|[From the Guardian:] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|677|Dear and valued co-worker: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|678|I deeply appreciate the spirit that so powerfully animates you in the service of our beloved Faith. You are a great asset to the Cause you serve so devotedly. I will pray for the extension and consolidation of your service from the depths of my heart. Persevere in your historic task, rest assured, and be happy. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|10|paragraph|679|Your true and grateful brother,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|682|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|683|Your letter, dated May 7th, has been received by our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|684|He was very pleased to see with what determination and dedication you are serving the Cause in Alaska. Now that two pioneers have gone forth from there, your labour is all the more important, and he certainly hopes that, through the medium of the Arctic Trails Shopping Service, the public meetings being held weekly, and the devoted labours of all the dear friends there, the Faith will rapidly reach and enlighten many new souls. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|685|There is such a confusion in the world today, so much uncertainty, so much materialism, that it is very hard to hold the attention of even the more spiritually minded people. But we must persevere and do our best knowing this is our duty and that conditions will eventually change completely and follow Bahá’u’lláh’s Pattern. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|686|Please give his love to the Anchorage friends. You may be sure he will pray for you all, and for the success of your work, in the Holy Shrines. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|687|With warm Bahá’í love,
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|688|R. Rabbani 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|689|[From the Guardian:] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|690|Assuring you of my special and fervent prayers for your success, for the steady extension of your valued activities, for the consolidation of the historic work already achieved, and the realization of every hope you cherish for the promotion of our beloved Faith,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|694|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|695|Your letter to our beloved Guardian dated October 31st has been received, and, in spite of the fact that he is terribly busy, he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf because he would not like in any way to ever hurt the feelings of one of the friends. However, he suggests in the future you refer such questions to the N.S.A. and ask them to put you in touch with a Bahá’í teacher who can correspond with you. He himself cannot do this kind of work, because he is so overworked with the more urgent administrative affairs of the Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|696|To answer you briefly what the original state of the universe was no one as yet knows. But we believe God is a spiritual Being and did create it; how we do not know. We will have experience of God’s spirit through His Prophets in the next world, but God is too great for us to know without this Intermediary. The Prophets know God, but how is more than our human minds can grasp. We believe we attain in the next world to seeing the Prophets. There is certainly a future life. Heaven and hell are conditions within our own beings. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|697|He urges you to study carefully the Bahá’í books, and he will pray for your advancement and the success of your Bahá’í activities. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|698|With loving greetings,
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|699|R. Rabbani 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|700|[From the Guardian:] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|701|May the Beloved bless your efforts, guide and sustain you in your meritorious activities, in such a distant field, and enable you to win great and memorable victories in the teaching field.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|705|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|706|Your most interesting gift has been received, through the kindness of Leroy Ioas, and it is deeply appreciated. I thank you for the thought as well as the gift. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|707|These are busy days in Haifa with the many pilgrims who are coming and going. The news of the rapid growth of the Faith in various lands is very inspiring, and the pilgrims leave the Holy Land for their posts with a new determination to play nobly their parts. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|708|With warm Bahá’í love,
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|709|Rúhíyyih 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|710|P.S. I should also say the beloved Guardian appreciated very much the Eskimo things.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|712|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|713|Your letter of August 5th has been received by the beloved Guardian and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|714|As the Guardian is very busy indeed these days, the answer will be brief. Your plan to return to Alaska makes him very happy indeed. He attaches the greatest importance to Alaska, and it will become increasingly important in the future. Therefore, he urges you by all means to return to that land, and there lend your valuable assistance in the service of Bahá’u’lláh. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|715|The Guardian assures you your dedication and service to the Faith are very deeply appreciated. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|716|With warm Bahá’í greetings,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|723|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|724|Your loving letter of February 14th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge it on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|725|The contribution which you have made to the Shrine of the Báb is very greatly appreciated. Receipt is enclosed herewith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|726|The work on the dome of the Shrine is going forward quite satisfactorily. The brim of the dome has been finished. As additional units of the building are completed, it adds to the stateliness of the entire structure, and permits one to realize how beautiful it is going to be. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|727|The Guardian very deeply appreciates the wonderful work you are doing in connection with the spread of the Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|728|The Eskimo booklet which you submitted for his approval he feels should be submitted to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States for their review. The reason for this is that they are closely in touch with the teaching work, and therefore well qualified to decide just what should and what should not be included in such a pamphlet. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|729|He hopes you and Frances Wells will work very closely with the National Spiritual Assembly in connection with this important service. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|730|The Guardian is extremely anxious that the Eskimos be brought into the Faith. He values very highly indeed the very wonderful services rendered by Mrs. Wells. He feels that she has sacrificed very deeply in order to carry the light of guidance to the seeking peoples of the world, particularly in Alaska, and now with the Eskimos. You may be sure the Guardian will pray for her spiritual success and her spiritual happiness. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|731|The Guardian will likewise be very happy to pray for Mrs. Hadley Ferguson of Fairbanks, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Greene, Mr. and Mrs. L.E. Pirkey, Mrs. Perry Bane, and Dr. Saul Mackoff. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|10|paragraph|732|The Guardian has communicated with the National Spiritual Assembly with regard to the efforts being made by yourself and Mrs. Wells as well as others in connection with the introduction of the Faith amongst the Eskimos, asking them to render every possible assistance to this most important work. It is impossible to let you know how important the Guardian feels the introduction of the Faith amongst the Eskimos is at this particular time. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|11|paragraph|733|With warm Bahá’í greetings,
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|12|paragraph|734|Leroy Ioas
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|13|paragraph|735|Assistant Secretary 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|14|paragraph|736|P.S.—The draft of your pamphlet is being sent direct to the National Spiritual Assembly. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|section|737|(63) December 7, 1953 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|738|All Pioneers: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|739|Dearly Beloved Friends, 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|740|The beloved Guardian sends you his loving greetings, and he assures you of his prayers in your behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|741|You will be most happy to know that at this time there is only one country, Chagos Archipelago, which has not been assigned to a settler, outside of the countries which are under Iron Curtain influence. More pioneers are arriving at their posts daily, so that at the present time, 71 of the new countries of the Crusade have been opened to the Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|742|You are now the representative of the Faith in your area, and the beloved Guardian feels assured that you will arise to the great opportunity that has come to you, to become the one to quicken the souls in your virgin territory and become the spiritual conqueror of that new land. The Guardian realizes you will have many problems and difficulties, but he urges you to persevere under all circumstances; not to become disheartened in any way, but relying solely upon Bahá’u’lláh and His quickening Spirit, arise at once to carry forward the teaching work. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|743|The Guardian makes the following suggestions with regard to teaching in virgin areas, at this critical time: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|744|1. No publicity should be secured. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|745|2. No articles should be placed in newspapers or magazines. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|746|3. Do not contact Authorities or Political Leaders. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|10|paragraph|747|4. Do not discuss Government policies in any way. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|11|paragraph|748|5. No effort should be made toward a public proclamation of the Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|12|paragraph|749|6. Proceed with great caution. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|13|paragraph|750|7. Be very wise in the manner in which the Teachings of the Faith are presented. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|14|paragraph|751|8. Make friends, and when these friends gain confidence in you and you in them, gradually confirm them in the Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|15|paragraph|752|9. What is needed is a complete reliance upon Bahá’u’lláh; pure consecration to the Faith, and then energetic but wise presentation of the Divine teachings. Such selfless sacrificial devotion will attract the divine confirmations, and gradually you will confirm souls who will join you as strong supporters of the Faith in your area. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|16|paragraph|753|With warm Bahá’í greetings,
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|17|paragraph|754|Faithfully yours,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|759|Dear Bahá’í Sister: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|760|Your letter of October 9th was duly received by the beloved Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge it on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|761|He very deeply appreciates the contribution which you have made in behalf of the Eskimos of Alaska. Receipt therefor is enclosed herewith. It is fitting that the Eskimos of Alaska be associated with the work of the Shrine of the Báb, and your having made this gift in their behalf is very appropriate, especially as you are endeavoring to work with the Eskimos in that country. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|762|The Guardian feels that you should write to the American National Spiritual Assembly in detail concerning the problem of Groups, Assemblies, etc. outside of Fairbanks. Certainly some basis should be set up for the establishment of such Groups and Assemblies, and he feels sure that within the principles that have already been enunciated, the American National Spiritual Assembly can properly handle the matter. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|763|At his direction I am sending a copy of this letter to the National Assembly, so that they will be informed of the matter when you write to them. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|764|The Guardian greatly values your sacrificial and devoted services to the Faith. He is praying in your behalf. He likewise will pray for the friends in Alaska, and also for those who are being attracted to the Faith, particularly Mr. English, who is half Eskimo. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|765|The Guardian was deeply appreciative of the spirit which animated you in preparing the tape recording of the Ridván Feast held in the home of an Eskimo family in Fairbanks. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|766|With warm Bahá’í greetings, I am

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|771|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|772|Your loving communication of December 5th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge it on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|773|The contribution which you have made to the Shrine of the Báb is greatly appreciated. Receipt is enclosed herewith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|774|The beloved Guardian is very happy because of the response of the friends throughout the world to the Ten Year Crusade. All of the virgin areas, with the exception of the Iron Curtain countries, are settled or assigned to pioneers. There are now over seventy of the virgin areas settled by pioneers, which bring the number of countries within the pale of the Faith to over two hundred. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|775|The Guardian is now deeply concerned with the development of the Faith in the homelands. If the Faith is not developed and spread in the homelands, it will ultimately affect the success of the work in foreign lands. The Guardian therefore hopes that the believers who have not been able to go to foreign areas will, in accordance with the Master’s instructions, scatter to the goal cities in the homelands, and thus aid in the establishment of Spiritual Assemblies. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|776|What is needed to achieve success in the teaching field is a complete dedication on the part of the individual, consecration to the glorious task of spreading the Faith, and the living of the Bahá’í life, because that creates the magnet for the Holy Spirit, and it is the Holy Spirit which quickens the new soul. Thus, the individual should be as a reed, through which the Holy Spirit may flow, to give new life to the seeking soul. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|777|One should search out those who are receptive to the Faith, and then concentrate on those persons in their teaching. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|778|The Bahá’ís in Alaska have a special responsibility, and that is to spread the Faith rapidly in that vast country. The success of the teaching work done by the Bahá’ís of Alaska will determine how soon a National Spiritual Assembly will be established in your country. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|779|The beloved Guardian is praying for the success of your efforts. He sends his loving greetings to you.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|784|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|785|The beloved Guardian greatly appreciated the spirit of your loving letter of December 28th, addressed to me, and has asked me to assure you of his prayers in your behalf, for the success of the noble mission you have undertaken. He will pray that the divine confirmations may be with you always, so that many souls may find eternal life, in that far off land, through your devoted and sacrificial efforts. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|786|He was pleased with the establishment of the fund for the Hazírá for Alaska. It is his hope, the Friends will arise with renewed effort in the Teaching Field, so many new centers and Assembies may be estabished, thus enabling Alaska to achieve its supreme goal of the NSA early in the Ten-Year Plan. Then the time will be ripe for the building of the Hazírá, for which the Friends are now contributing funds.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|792|Your loving letter of February 8th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge it on his behalf. Your contribution to the international interests of the Faith is greatly appreciated by him. Receipt is enclosed herewith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|793|The Guardian is very happy with the development of the teaching work in the virgin areas of the Ten-Year Crusade. Over 84 of the countries have now been settled, bringing the number of countries within the pale of the Faith to over 216. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|794|The Guardian is hopeful that the friends at home will arise with the same spirit of sacrifice and determination as the pioneers abroad, and teach and spread the Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|795|More Bahá’ís, more Groups, more Assemblies, are the immediate goals before the friends at home. He feels sure the friends will arise as never before, and filled with the Holy Spirit, quicken the seeking souls, leading many to the bourn of immortality. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|796|Dedication to the heavenly task, complete consecration to the noble mission, and living the life, are the requirements for success in the teaching field. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|797|The beloved Guardian greatly values the active services of you two devoted workers in the Faith. As you know, the Guardian feels that the future of Alaska is very important indeed, particularly the city of Anchorage. One of the goals of the Ten Year Crusade is the establishment of a National Assembly in Alaska. This great bounty carries with it great responsibilities; and therefore the Guardian is hopeful that each and every Bahá’í in Alaska will redouble their efforts in order to spread the Faith far and wide, and to bring many new souls into the Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|798|The Guardian feels sure that you two will render distinguished and outstanding services in connection with the development of the Cause in Alaska during the present Crusade. He assures you of his prayers in your behalf, and sends you his loving greetings.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|802|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|803|Your loving letter of March 16th has been received through the courtesy of Mrs. Tuttle. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|804|We have prayed at the Shrines for the solution of your problems; that all obstacles may be removed from your path, and that your true field of Bahá’í service may become clear and evident. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|805|As a general principle, the Guardian has established the order of importance in Bahá’í service as follows: First, Pioneering in one of the virgin areas of the Ten Year Crusade. Second, Pioneering in one of the consolidation areas of the Ten Year Crusade. Third, Settlement and Teaching in one of the goal cities of the home front campaign. This of course would include developing the Faith in Communities where there is already a Group or isolated Bahá’ís. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|806|The Guardian feels that it is advisable for every individual, after his own prayers and meditations and seeking of guidance, to consult with the appropriate committee appointed by the National Assembly. They are in touch with the ramifications of the Campaign, and are qualified to give sound advice. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|807|So far as your personal affairs are concerned, the Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf, that they may be clarified for you. Of course the question of love and marriage is something that can only be determined by the individual. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|paragraph|808|So far as the publication of the pamphlet in Eskimo is concerned, it probably would be advisable for you to write the National Assembly on this important matter, asking them what the present status is, and if you can assist in any way. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|paragraph|809|With loving Bahá’í greetings, I am, 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|paragraph|810|Faithfully yours,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|814|Dear Bahá’í Brother: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|815|Your letter of April 21st has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|816|He appreciated your loving thought in sending him Ridván Greetings from a new Alaskan Center.[15] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|817|He attaches the greatest importance to the spread of the Faith in that territory, because, as you know, it is destined to have a National Spiritual Assembly of its own ere the termination of the Ten Year Plan; and the sooner the believers can open up new centers and establish new Spiritual Assemblies, the sooner will the happy day come when Alaska will be independent, and have its own national Bahá’í Body. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|818|He assures you he will certainly pray that your sacrifices and your services may be richly rewarded. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|819|He urges you to concentrate on attracting the natives as much as possible, by that he means the Eskimos. These people have a right to hear of the glorious message of Bahá’u’lláh, and he hopes you will be instrumental in attracting many of them to the Faith.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|829|He is delighted to see that you are in one of the goal cities in Alaska, and that you have been joined by Miss Meyer. He feels sure that this nucleus will soon attract to itself sufficient new Bahá’ís to create a Spiritual Assembly.[16] 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|830|He urges you to persevere, and assures you of his prayers for your success.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|836|He will pray that your personal affairs may work out happily. He fully approves of your going to Selewik, where you can be of greater service to the Faith than in Fairbanks, where there are now a number of Bahá’ís, until such time as you can arrange to carry the Teachings into the far north. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|837|He assures you his loving prayers will always surround you in your devoted efforts to serve the Faith so dear to your heart.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|846|Your letter of December 15th has been received by the beloved Guardian; and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|847|He is happy to know that you are engaged in the service of the Faith, and will pray that you may be strenghthened to perform befittingly your part, and may be instrumental in guiding others to this great Cause. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|848|He urges you to teach all you can, both in Anchorage, and, if possible, in surrounding towns. As you know, Alaska is to establish its own National Spiritual Assembly during the World Crusade; and the first step is the formation of a sufficient number of Local Spiritual Assemblies. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|849|In his visits to the Holy Shrines, he will remember all the members of your family. He hopes your two dear children will become pure and noble examples of the Bahá’í life, and worthy instruments for the service of the Cause. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|850|He will also remember in his supplications all the dear friends in that land.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|859|The beloved Guardian has received your letter of February 10th, and has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|860|In view of the fact that he hopes that in the not-too-distant future Alaska will have its own Spiritual Assembly, he advises you to remain in Alaska, and try to find employment in some place other than Anchorage, where you can assist in establishing another Local Spiritual Assembly. There must be a sufficient number of local Assemblies in Alaska in order to form a broad basis for the National Body to be erected upon. He feels that this would be the greatest service you could render at this time.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|871|He deeply appreciates your devotion and service to the Faith. You must not become discouraged, but strive diligently to consolidate the Faith in that important area. He feels the Hazíratu’l-Quds itself will prove to be an instrument to attract new souls to the Cause.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|881|Your loving letter of October 31st has been received by the Beloved Guardian, and he has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf. The contribution which you have made to the International Fund is greatly appreciated. Receipt is enclosed. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|882|Alaska is a most important country, especially mentioned by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Tablets of the Divine Plan. The Friends there must arise with renewed effort to spread the Glad Tidings and win souls to the Cause of God. There should be many assemblies, groups and Isolated centers, for the formation of the National Assembly, and its vigorous functioning. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|883|The Guardian was happy to learn that Alaska is awake to the Faith, as never before. It therefore remains to see what the Friends will do; for it is now in their hands to raise the heights of their spiritual endeavors. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|884|The Guardian assures you, and all the Friends in Alaska of his prayers in their behalf; for the success of their work; and the confirmation of many souls in the Kingdom of God.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|889|Dear Bahá’í Friends: 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|890|The beloved Guardian has received your letter of January 3rd, and has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|891|He was very happy to hear of the declaration of Miss Johnson,[17] and particularly of the translation into Aleut of the excerpt from Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings. Likewise, he was very happy to know that you are building a Bahá’í Center,[18] which he will consider as an auxiliary to the other goals the friends are winning all over the world. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|892|Perhaps one should not approach the people in that country[19] on the basis of religion, but rather through the social teachings of the Faith and its Laws, and make them understand the need for World Order, rather than giving them the religious aspect first, when they are so fanatically attached to their church. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|893|He will certainly pray that you may find receptive souls, and the slow work of conversion be begun. No doubt once they embrace the Faith, they will be very staunch. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|894|Assuring you all of his loving prayers and his appreciation of your persevering services,

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|903|Your letter of April 5th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|paragraph|904|He feels that now that you have found the thing you were searching for inwardly, and have this added joy in your life of our glorious Faith, you should be kinder to your husband and more considerate than ever, and do everything in your power to make him feel that this has not taken you away from him, but only made your love for him and your desire to be a good wife to him, greater. Whether he will ultimately be able to become a Bahá’í or not, is something that only time can tell; but there is no doubt where your duty lies, and that is to make him appreciate the fact that your new affiliation has not interfered in any way with his home life or his marriage, but on the contrary, has strengthened both. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|paragraph|905|It is very difficult when one has found what one knows is the truth, to sit by and see a dear and close relative completely blind to it. The temptation is to try and “stir them up and make them see the light”, but this is often disastrous. Silence, love and forbearance will win greater victories in such cases. However, your husband has no right to ask you to give up being a Bahá’í. That is going too far. Nobody should trespass on the sacred bond every human being has a right to have with their Creator. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|paragraph|906|The Guardian assures you he will pray that you may be guided to do the right thing at this difficult time, and that your husband’s attitude may change.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|section|926|(81) ALASKA—Important 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|927|Your letter to our beloved Guardian was received, dated September 10th, and he is very happy to welcome you into the service of this glorious Faith, and especially to see that you are going to serve in Alaska, a country to which he attaches great importance. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|section|928|(82) ALASKA—Incorporation of L.S.A. and growth 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|929|He was also delighted to hear of the incorporation of Anchorage. The Faith is certainly going ahead by leaps and bounds in the “barren North”! 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|3|section|930|(83) ALASKA—Spirit of confidence 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|931|He was delighted with all the good news you conveyed of the progress of the Cause in Alaska, the radio broadcasts, the new believers, and the spirit of confidence and devotion which animates you all in serving our precious Faith. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|4|section|932|(84) ALASKA—Unity of believers 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|933|He was very happy to hear of the unity of the Alaskan Bahá’ís; they are a Community particularly dear to his heart, and he hopes that in the years to come the Cause will make remarkable progress in that land. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|5|section|934|(85) ANTI-CHRIST 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|935|We do not believe in Anti-Christ in the sense the Christians do. Anyone who violently and determinedly sought to oppose the Manifestation could be called an “anti-Christ,” such as the Vazír in the Báb’s day, Ḥájí Mírzá Aqásí. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|section|936|(86) CHRIST—RESURRECTION 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|937|We do not believe that there was a bodily resurrection after the crucifixion of Christ, but that there was a time after His ascension when His disciples perceived spiritually His true greatness and realized He was eternal in being. This is what has been reported symbolically in the New Testament and been misunderstood. His eating with His disciples after resurrection is the same thing. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|7|section|938|(87) CHRIST—Virgin Birth 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|939|What science calls a virgin birth we do not associate with that of Jesus Christ, which we believe to have been a miracle and a sign of His Prophethood. In this matter we are in entire agreement with the most orthodox church views. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|8|section|940|(88) FEAR—Overcoming fear 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|941|He will certainly pray that you may entirely over-come your fear-complex. When you concentrate your thoughts on realizing that you now belong to Bahá’u’lláh, are His servant whom He loves and will always help, if you ask Him to, and that the great spiritual strength of the Cause of God is behind you for you to draw upon, you will soon see your fears melting away. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|9|section|942|(89) FOOD-Storage 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|943|With regard to the storing of food—this is something which the Spiritual Assembly will have to determine, based on local conditions; and based on discussions with Local Authorities. The Guardian feels it is not a subject which can be generally legislated upon. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|10|section|944|(90) GOD—Nature of our Knowledge 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|945|We find God only through the Intermediary of His Prophet. We see the Perfection of God in His Prophets. Time and space are physical things; God, the Creator, is not a “place” as we conceive of place in physical terms. God is the Infinite Essence, the Creator. We cannot picture Him or His state, but if we did, we would be His equals, not His creatures. God is never flesh, but mirrored in the attributes of His Prophets we see His Divine characteristics and perfections. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|11|section|946|(91) IMMORTALITY—Cause of Happiness 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|947|He will pray for the progress and happiness of the soul of your dear daughter in the invisible, spiritual worlds. He feels your attitude in this physical separation from her is exemplary, and is causing her great happiness now. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|12|section|948|(92) INVESTMENTS 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|949|He leaves such matters as investments, etc., to the discretion of individuals who are free to consult experts and make their own decisions, and he feels this applies also to the shares in the prospective oil land which you asked his advice about. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|13|section|950|(93) MANIFESTATIONS—Future Manifestations 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|951|The bud, the flower, the fruit are only symbols to convey to us the sense of the progress being made by man in receiving ever fuller Revelations from God. In spite of the vast spiritual significance of what Bahá’u’lláh has brought to the world we humans have infinite progress to make in the future. Future Prophets will bring us new laws suitable to our state of development and continue to educate us on this planet, but they will be under the shadow of Bahá’u’lláh for five thousand centuries. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|14|section|952|(94) PHOTOGRAPHS—of the Master 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|953|There is no objection to your copying pictures of the Master for your friends, but do not do it on a wholesale scale. He has always preferred that the friends should have the Master’s photo rather than his own. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|15|section|954|(95) PRAYER 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|955|We cannot know God directly, but only through His Prophets. We can pray to Him, realizing that through His Prophets we know Him, or we can address our prayer in thought to Bahá’u’lláh, not as God, but as the Door to our knowing God. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|16|section|956|(96) PRE-EXISTENCE—of Prophets 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|957|The Prophets, unlike us, are pre-existent. The soul of Christ existed in the spiritual world before His birth in this world. We cannot imagine what that world is like, so words are inadequate to picture His state of being. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|17|section|958|(97) JOSEPH SMITH—Statements in Book of Mormon 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|959|As there is nothing specific about Joseph Smith in the teachings, the Guardian has no statement to make on his position or about the accuracy of any statement in the Book of Mormon regarding American history or its peoples. This is a matter for historians to pass upon. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|18|section|960|(98) SOUL—Origin 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|961|The soul or spirit of the individual comes into being with the conception of his physical body. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|19|section|962|(99) STUDY 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|963|Shoghi Effendi advises you to study “Some Answered Questions” and the “Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh” which help you to grasp these questions. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|20|section|964|(100) TEACHINGS—Acceleration 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|965|The Guardian was very happy to learn that the teaching work in Alaska is being accelerated. May the momentum being gained, not be lost, but on the other hand intensified, so the forthcoming National Assembly may have a wide and strong base. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|2|paragraph|966|The world is seeking for a solution for its increasing problems, and if the friends arise with the dynamic spirit of the Faith, assured of final victory, many seeking souls will enter the Faith, and find eternal life. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|21|section|967|(101) TEACHING—Importance 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|968|The more one observes the conditions of the world and the terrible problems confronting humanity, the more deeply one realizes that the only remedy is that which Bahá’u’lláh has brought, and yet, alas, the masses of the people seem to not yet be aware that the way out of our problems can only be a divine way, given by something far greater than human understanding! However, many souls are seriously thinking and seeking, and the Bahá’ís must try to bring the knowledge of the teachings to all, so that those prepared to accept may not be denied the Message. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|22|section|969|(102) TEACHING—Participation of Children 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|970|He is happy that the children are being attracted. They are the pillars of the future, and should be trained and encouraged in every way, to learn the details of the teachings, and how to teach others. For the true source of existence is the diffusing of Glad Tidings. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|23|section|971|(103) TEACHING—Remaining at Post 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|972|He would certainly advise you to remain in Alaska and continue to teach and give the small but devoted Community there your active support. 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|24|section|973|(104) TEACHING—Teaching Relatives 
Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|1|paragraph|974|He would not advise you to in any way force the teachings on your husband, but rather through prayer, love and example attract his heart to what he will be forced to see has not only made you a happier person but a better wife and mother than ever before. It is often most difficult to teach those nearest to us, but the Guardian will earnestly pray that your husband and children will join you in serving this wonderful Cause.

Bahá’í|Shoghi Effendi|High Endeavours|6|paragraph|1015|[6] (Letter No. 17) Based on these directions from the Guardian, the first Hazíratu’l-Quds was purchased inside the City limits at 810–8th Avenue. At that time (1955) the population of Anchorage was less than 25,000 concentrated around what is now downtown Anchorage. Following the earthquake in 1964, it was necessary to abandon the original Hazíratu’l-Quds. The property was sold for $20,000 and a diligent year-long effort was made to find a suitable replacement. Nothing appropriate could be found inside the city limits within the price range. Guidance was requested from the Universal House of Justice. In a letter dated May 11, 1965, they stated the following, “...we feel that it is more important that you should acquire a national Hazíratu’l-Quds for Alaska without delay. Preferably is should be within the civic limits of Anchorage but if you cannot find a suitable building which can be purchased for the $20,000 which you have available, you should look for a location in the immediate suburbs of Anchorage....”
