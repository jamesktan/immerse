Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|chapter|6|PRELUDE
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|7|’Tis not from sages, nor from learned books 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|8|That man gains wisdom. In his secret breast 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|9|A Chamber lies wherein he sometimes looks 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|10|And listens. There his troubled soul finds rest,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|11|And there, if he adores, his life is blest.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|12|The gloomy dust which rises from men’s minds, 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|13|In their eternal search for certainty,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|14|Obscures the spirit’s vision, and so blinds 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|15|The eye of heart that, failing Truth to see,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|16|They grope and wander in perplexity.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|17|But sometimes - Ah, that blessed, unwarned hour! 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|18|The dust is scattered by a mystic breeze:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|13|paragraph|19|Upon man’s heated mind there falls a shower 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|20|From Fount Celestial, and his heart finds ease 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|15|paragraph|21|Which only God can give - Such hours are these.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|chapter|22|HOUR ONE
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|section|23|ARGUMENT:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|24|Man desires God with all his heart, and in its secret Chamber holds with Him high converse. He asks God why He hides from him; says that he seeks with telescope, microscope and in the mind, but in vain. God warns him that He is not thus to be found but, rather, in the Spiritual Universe, His Home. Man asks how he may find this Universe of God and hears that all the Prophets have come to men as Guides to the way of true Life. Man complains that the Prophets have always been slain by men: how, then, can God’s love be found in men’s hearts? He is told that the true Man, is not mirrored in the lower self of man but in his true Self which is mirrored in the Prophets themselves; that man’s vision is too limited to judge correctly the long history of the race from cell to man, much less the immortal life ahead of him. Man sees no certainty of life beyond the grave for death seems victorious. God assures him that the thought of death as the end of life is superstition and reassures him. Man is content.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|section|25|Man Speaks:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|26|WHY dost Thou hide Thyself from me, O God? 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|27|Where’er throughout the ages man hath trod
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|28|His mind and soul hath sought Thee. All in vain! 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|29|He can but hope and trust: but I would know.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|30|I search through far-flung depths of stellar space; 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|31|I grope adown the labyrinths of mind;
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|32|I peer into each microscopic place 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|33|And find all else: but Thee I cannot find.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|section|34|God Speaks:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|35|IT is not I who hide, ’tis thou art blind.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|36|Thine insight is so dimmed thou canst not see 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|37|That My Creation’s Book revealeth Me;
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|38|That every atom is an open door 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|39|Inviting thee to enter and explore!
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|40|What dost thou hope to see 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|41|When thou goest seeking Me?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|42|A Face? A Voice? A word writ on the sky?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|43|If I should speak who art thou to reply?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|44|If I should write some guiding Word to men 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|45|Could they interpret My Supremest Pen?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|46|For is thine eye so keen, thy mind so sure,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|13|paragraph|47|That when My Spirit moves thee, and I lure 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|48|Thy longing soul afar 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|15|paragraph|49|To probe the mote and star,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|16|paragraph|50|Thou canst in such wise hope to limit Me 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|17|paragraph|51|Who doth surround what mind and eye can see?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|18|paragraph|52|Canst thou thus find Me Who both far and near 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|19|paragraph|53|Create? Who causeth all things to appear 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|20|paragraph|54|And them inspire? Who willeth dawns to break, 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|21|paragraph|55|And rivers flow, and suns their orbits make?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|22|paragraph|56|Such futile search shall surely be unblest.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|23|paragraph|57|What then, My son, didst thou desire to prove? 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|24|paragraph|58|Canst thy frail mind encompass thus My love?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|25|paragraph|59|O son of Love! For thee can be no rest 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|26|paragraph|60|Save love for Me and calm upon My breast.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|27|paragraph|61|Wert thou through all eternity to seek,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|28|paragraph|62|And through immensity of space to roam,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|29|paragraph|63|Thy spirit shall no foot-hold find,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|30|paragraph|64|No answer to thy questing mind,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|31|paragraph|65|Except to My command thou shalt bow down; 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|32|paragraph|66|Unless My Love thou wearest like a crown,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|33|paragraph|67|And find in meeting Me thy spirit’s home.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|34|paragraph|68|I am not far from thee but ever near:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|35|paragraph|69|Listen to thy heart’s whisper: "I am here.”
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|36|paragraph|70|There lies but one soul-step ’twixt thee and Me: 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|37|paragraph|71|Take that one step into Eternity.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|38|paragraph|72|That Life; is now if thou that step wilt take 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|39|paragraph|73|And from thy temple vigorously shake 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|40|paragraph|74|The ragged mantle of mortality.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|41|paragraph|75|For that My royal robe I offer thee,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|42|paragraph|76|And bid thee share My Eternality.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|section|77|Man Speaks:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|78|THESE things have I from youth been taught, O Lord
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|79|I know this as I know some Sanscrit word 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|80|A learned man once taught me. Ah, but still 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|81|I seek and find Thee not. I find not God 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|82|Within my heart, nor in the star nor clod.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|83|’Tis Thee I want: O, pray that need fulfil!
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|84|A fire glows ever in my yearning breast 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|85|Which only knowing Thee can quench. No rest 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|86|Nor peace I ask, no mortal anguish shun,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|87|Could I but purchase thus the vision clear 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|88|Of Thee. Not words about Thee: I have done 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|89|With words. For this no price nor pain too dear.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|section|90|God Speaks:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|91|O THOU of visions twain! The outer eye
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|92|Close fast and open wide thine insight keen, 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|93|Then thou shalt see that I had just begun 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|94|Creation when I made the moon and sun,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|95|The earth, and all thine outer eye hath seen.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|96|My Universe of spirit is so vast,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|97|So filled with beauty and with Light supreme,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|98|That when men glimpse It they all lightly cast 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|99|This world aside: a barren, ugly dream.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|section|100|Man Speaks:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|101|O GOD! O God! The world I sense is all 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|102|That I can know. Thou gavest me a mind 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|103|Which honestly I use: yet there’s a call 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|104|Resounding in my heart which bids me find 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|105|A higher world. O help me: I am blind!
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|section|106|God Speaks:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|107|THE heavens of My Mercy are so vast;
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|108|The Oceans of My Bounty so unbound,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|109|That never hath a soul besought unblest, 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|110|Nor any seeker but hath surely found.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|111|It is for this that all My Prophets came 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|112|That They might lead men thither, and man’s claim 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|113|To paradise, which like celestial fire 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|114|I lighted in his heart, substantiate.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|115|Not temples to My Glory dedicate
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|116|Nor prayers from sullied lips that supplicate,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|117|Do They desire, nor can with Me prevail.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|118|My Prophets came that every fleshly veil 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|13|paragraph|119|Be rent between man’s soaring soul and Me,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|120|And he, in his Reality, be free.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|15|paragraph|121|Ah, once again celestial songs assail
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|16|paragraph|122|Man’s heedless ear. When will My Children rise
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|17|paragraph|123|And cast aside their leaden-heavy chains,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|18|paragraph|124|And all their egocentric, earth-born pains,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|19|paragraph|125|And soar, detached, in My resplendent skies!
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|20|paragraph|126|The whale by seeking cannot find the sea;
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|21|paragraph|127|The eagle, soaring high 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|22|paragraph|128|Against My blue-domed sky,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|23|paragraph|129|Finds not the air, nor can thy mind find Me 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|24|paragraph|130|Who in thy heart of hearts is truly thee.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|25|paragraph|131|About thee and above, beneath, within,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|26|paragraph|132|Thy mystery am I and thou art Mine.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|27|paragraph|133|No flight avails: nor height nor depth, nor sin, 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|28|paragraph|134|Nor death, nor hell can part thee from My Love.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|29|paragraph|135|My lamp thou art and I the Light within,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|30|paragraph|136|Know this, O servant, as the swallow knows 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|31|paragraph|137|The air: the fish the boundless seas they rove;
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|32|paragraph|138|The leaf the wind which by My order blows.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|section|139|Man Speaks:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|140|HOW can I know this, God, when all I see 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|141|Seems fiercely bent on crushing petty me? 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|142|That very wind on which the swallow flies 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|143|Haply resounds with some doomed sailor’s cries.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|section|144|God Speaks:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|145|DOST thou, then, seek My love for selfish gain? 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|146|Did I not hear thee say no care nor pain
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|147|Would be too great a price to see My Face? 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|148|Yet when a little I withdraw the veils 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|149|That thou, through suffering, may tread the place 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|150|Of Holiness, then all thy courage fails.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|151|O son of man! The love that is sincere 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|152|Seeketh to prove that love through sacrifice.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|153|Look how the merchant seeks year after year 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|154|For goodly pearls. The pearl of greatest price 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|155|Once having found all lesser pearls are naught. 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|156|For very joy, and with that joy distraught, 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|13|paragraph|157|He hastens to the market-place and sells 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|158|All that he hath that he may buy that pearl.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|15|paragraph|159|He selleth all: not lesser pearls alone,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|16|paragraph|160|But home and fields. He selleth all he hath 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|17|paragraph|161|That he may for those withered gods atone.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|18|paragraph|162|And note the moth. It flutters 'round the light 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|19|paragraph|163|Though its frail wings be singed. It loves that bright 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|20|paragraph|164|Consuming flame more than ephemeral life.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|21|paragraph|165|These count it not a sacrifice to give 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|22|paragraph|166|Their all if, giving, they receive far more.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|23|paragraph|167|If thou in My Companionship shouldst live 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|24|paragraph|168|Perchance that bliss would cheapen all thy store.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|25|paragraph|169|And dost thou think, O stranger to the Friend
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|26|paragraph|170|That there is room within thine inmost heart 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|27|paragraph|171|For Me, the Whole, and any lesser part?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|28|paragraph|172|If thou wouldst know Me, know none else but Me: 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|29|paragraph|173|If thou wouldst love Me, lesser loves deny.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|30|paragraph|174|If thou shouldst die in Me I’ll live in thee:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|31|paragraph|175|For this, My son, wouldst thou not gladly die?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|32|paragraph|176|The steed on which man journeys to My Love 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|33|paragraph|177|Is pain, since ’tis through pain he longs to prove 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|34|paragraph|178|His love. No loss can do My lover harm 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|35|paragraph|179|Since underneath he knows My tender Arm.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|36|paragraph|180|He travels through the Garden of My Love 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|37|paragraph|181|And plucks the hyacinths of Knowledge sweet, 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|38|paragraph|182|And enters to My Union with sure feet.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|39|paragraph|183|He listens with Mine Ear and hears the dove 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|40|paragraph|184|Of Paradise, and with Mine Eye he gazes 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|41|paragraph|185|Upon the wonders of My World. He razes 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|42|paragraph|186|Every mountain with the hand of Might 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|43|paragraph|187|Stretched from the bosom of Omnipotence.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|44|paragraph|188|At every moment with Mine insight he 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|45|paragraph|189|Becomes informed of some new mystery;
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|46|paragraph|190|With every passing hour
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|47|paragraph|191|He demonstrates My Power
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|48|paragraph|192|And gone is all his earth-born impotence.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|49|paragraph|193|His life he gives to Me with every breath 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|50|paragraph|194|And never counts it sacrifice. The fires 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|51|paragraph|195|Of hell are cool and he finds life in death 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|52|paragraph|196|For he hath merged with Mine all his desires 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|53|paragraph|197|And to submerge his will in Mine aspires.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|section|198|Man Speaks:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|199|SUCH things are far too high for my weak mind
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|200|Or heart to compass. Lord, how can I find 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|201|This Path that leads to Thine Abode? How gain 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|202|The strength, the will to be that which I fain 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|203|Would be? To do that which I yearn to do?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|204|The souls who thus attain are sadly few.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|205|I look abroad upon Thy world and see 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|206|That man is bent on everything save Thee.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|207|Nor heart, nor mind, nor will contains Thee, God!
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|208|Beneath his cruel feet Thy sacred sod
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|209|Is spread with empires wrecked. In Thy blest Name
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|210|He drags Thy saints and heroes to the flame,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|13|paragraph|211|The rack, the sword, the dungeon and the cross.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|212|He gains no whit: he findeth only loss,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|15|paragraph|213|And yet he blindly goes his way. He strews 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|16|paragraph|214|The earth with bones of innocence. The news 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|17|paragraph|215|Of daily crime and lust befouls the page 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|18|paragraph|216|Of history. He vents his filthy rage 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|19|paragraph|217|On every brother man. He lifts the rod 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|20|paragraph|218|Of hate in home and church, in court and mart.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|21|paragraph|219|He seems to hold all hell within his heart 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|22|paragraph|220|Not Thee - not Thee! Is this Thy Will, O God?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|section|221|God Speaks:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|222|THY speakest thou of "man”?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|223|Thy heart’s page scan.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|224|Is Christ thus listed, the true Son of Man?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|225|Man is not Man because of wealth and fame,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|226|Nor yet because he calls upon My Name.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|227|Not learning nor refinement marks true Man:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|228|He’s only such when he conforms to plan 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|229|Divine, and with My attributes adorns 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|230|His temple: for the true Man ever scorns 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|231|The beast within, the relic of his long 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|232|Ascent from primal cell. His triumphs throng 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|233|That Path which led from mineral to man.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|13|paragraph|234|And dost thou dream that thy blind eyes can scan 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|235|That journey vast, thy mind give judgment plain 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|15|paragraph|236|Of gain and loss through aeons long of pain?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|16|paragraph|237|And how much less art thou fit to discern 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|17|paragraph|238|Thine age-long future which My plans concern?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|18|paragraph|239|Yet do I love thee who darest question Me.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|19|paragraph|240|It is My Voice within thee that dost call;
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|20|paragraph|241|It is Mine Eye which earth’s dread sorrows see;

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|244|MY age-long future? What do these words mean?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|245|I see death stalking all the world: He takes 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|246|The high and low. The tree of life he shakes 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|247|Remorselessly and man drops from the scene.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|248|He pays no heed to pleading nor complaint:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|249|His cold hand strikes the sinner and the saint.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|250|The heart of mankind bleeds and, bleeding breaks. 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|251|Man is - is not. He lives, and then - hath been.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|252|The Lords of Life assure me of a bliss 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|253|Beyond the skies and I would fain believe:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|254|But learned men scoff sneeringly at this
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|255|And snatch from me the faith I would conceive.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|13|paragraph|256|"What is the sky?” they say, "'tis empty space S
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|257|tretching away illimitably far.”
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|15|paragraph|258|They point to Arcturus, that distant star,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|16|paragraph|259|And tell of "Light Years” while I hide my face,

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|18|paragraph|261|A home, in that vast gulf. I vainly pray.

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|265|As tidings glad: at its approach why flee? 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|266|That darkness have I for thee kindly made 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|267|A beckoning glory, not a threatening shade.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|268|Why dost thou screen thee from this splendid light 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|269|And close thine eyes, insisting it is night?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|270|Look thou with keenly penetrating eye:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|271|Canst thou in all My Universe descry 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|272|A trace of death? ’Tis change thou seest here 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|273|A change which leadeth but to life again:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|274|Death is a superstition born of fear.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|275|Think how the unborn babe would fear the pain
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|13|paragraph|276|Of parturition. If he could foresee
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|277|That venture vast would he not be aghast?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|15|paragraph|278|Would he not say that life can nowise be 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|16|paragraph|279|Outside his mother’s womb? " ’Tis her life blood 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|17|paragraph|280|That nurtures me; it is her heart that beats

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|20|paragraph|283|Yet, could he think, were he not wholly blind, 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|21|paragraph|284|Within his very being he would find 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|22|paragraph|285|A proof most plain of wider life to be.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|23|paragraph|286|For, in his organs, forming in the womb 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|24|paragraph|287|Is evidence that soon he will be free 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|25|paragraph|288|To use them. Even so it is with thee,

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|30|paragraph|293|Thy world, compared to Mine, is more a tomb 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|31|paragraph|294|Than life. Thou shouldst prepare thee to ascend.

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|33|paragraph|296|Thy hunger for true life is not assuaged.

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|35|paragraph|298|Of My Dominion an eternal part.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|36|paragraph|299|Can My Dominion ever be destroyed,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|37|paragraph|300|Or cast into a ghastly, boundless void?

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|319|Lies buried, for My Revelations flow 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|320|A thundering torrent. I have taken man 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|321|Into My secret councils and My Plan 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|322|As ne’er before disclosed. It is the season 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|323|When I with man in wisdom clearly reason.

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|325|And thy blind eyes shall open to My Wonder.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|chapter|326|HOUR TWO
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|section|327|ARGUMENT:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|328|Man’s longing still unappeased, and God having encouraged hint to ask until all doubts are set at rest, Man asks how he may find God in the created world. After a brief direction as to how man may find a key to such search God tells him that a Guide is necessary, and that such Guides have been provided: at which man is rejoiced and demands His Name. He is asked if man is sure that he would recognize his Guide if disguised in lowliness and hidden beneath Iniman clouds, and whether man is willing to sacrifice all and follow him when found. Man is overwhelmed but still unsatisfied. He asks regarding "Judgment Day” and "Heaven” and "Hell”. God explains these symbolic words.

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|chapter|795|HOUR THREE
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|section|796|ARGUMENT:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|797|Man asks concerning the problem of endless toil and fear of poverty. God explains the dignity of work if done ini the spirit of service, using Nature's service as an illustration. Man fears that if he serves alone he will be trodden down by selfish men. Hence, he is told an entirely new World Order is necessary and that His hosts are now building it. Man thinks this a dream, seeing no signs of this new Order. God assures him that His Command has gone forth and must be obeyed. He is also told that all who work for Right are in His Armies, whether they outwardly acknowledge Him or not, and that He has a Chosen Few who will lead His Hosts to victory. Man is .at last convinced and dedicates his life to the search for, and obedience to, His heavenly Guide. God promises His aid and confirmation.

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|964|Is sanctified. It is the Day foretold.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|965|See how the nations late so proud and bold 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|966|Are humbled in the shadow of their doom.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|13|paragraph|967|Their councils are in tumult; earthquakes roar 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|968|As the oppressed of men toss in the gloom,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|15|paragraph|969|And threaten those whom late they bowed before.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|16|paragraph|970|My Messenger hath come with healing wings 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|17|paragraph|971|And sword of Justice. To all wrong He brings 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|18|paragraph|972|Destruction; to the Right triumphant sway.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|19|paragraph|973|This is the meaning of My Prophet’s Word: 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|20|paragraph|974|"Behold the Great and Fearful Day of God.”
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|21|paragraph|975|My Trump hath blown: My Holy, venging Sword 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|22|paragraph|976|Hath cast the mighty from their seats. The sod 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|23|paragraph|977|So long drenched with the blood of innocence 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|24|paragraph|978|Shall bloom again. The time for penitence 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|25|paragraph|979|Is past. My Justice and My Love shall reign 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|26|paragraph|980|And earth shall be a paradise again.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|27|paragraph|981|Bewildered are the learned and the wise 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|28|paragraph|982|Of this world, and the nations tremble sore 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|29|paragraph|983|To their foundations.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|30|paragraph|984|But those blessed eyes
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|31|paragraph|985|Which kept awake and watched that they might see 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|32|paragraph|986|And greet My coming, these My Name adore 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|33|paragraph|987|And write upon their hearts My high Command. 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|34|paragraph|988|They take My Chalice from My generous Hand 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|35|paragraph|989|And drink with joy, their pure hearts all aflame,

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|40|paragraph|994|Praise be to Thee, beloved of our heart’s yearning!"
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|41|paragraph|995|This is the Day for which My dear Son prayed 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|42|paragraph|996|And taught men thus to pray. He with My aid 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|43|paragraph|997|Worked for My Kingdom; Its foundations laid 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|44|paragraph|998|In all men’s hearts with loving servitude.

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|1004|Whereon they hanged Him now is holy ground,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|1005|And men now worship Him they crowned 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|1006|With thorns.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|1007|O tell Me why, My son, is this 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|1008|Unless He held the secret of true bliss,

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|1013|Was this sweet sacrifice of His in vain?

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|1015|Where is such servitude, such love as His?

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|1025|Who to His Sacrifice uplift their praise,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|1026|Perhaps unconscious of the hymns they raise.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|1027|For every nail in Hid blest feet and hands

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|1033|Despite all this do men not torture Him 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|1034|Afresh each day? They raise false hands in prayer 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|1035|While with brass feet they trample on His poor.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|1036|There is no justice in man’s law,

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|1039|Nor pity in his granite heart.

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|1043|Cast by their brother man upon them all.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|13|paragraph|1044|A joyful song within the poor lies hid 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|1045|But on their mouths the rich have clamped a lid

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|16|paragraph|1047|There issues only a despairing sigh.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|17|paragraph|1048|They’ve raised their throbbing cry to Thee so long!

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|15|paragraph|1065|And from My Heavenly Host triumphant rings.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|16|paragraph|1066|My kind forbearance made oppressors bold;
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|17|paragraph|1067|My patience negligent their hearts hath made,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|18|paragraph|1068|Till now the flags of passion they unfold 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|19|paragraph|1069|And ride their steeds to death all unafraid.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|20|paragraph|1070|But know that I love Justice over all:

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|25|paragraph|1075|An eagle fierce is now pursuing them 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|26|paragraph|1076|And ordeals dire upon their footsteps tread.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|27|paragraph|1077|Except they turn and grasp My Garment’s hem 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|28|paragraph|1078|Of justice, they are numbered with the dead.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|29|paragraph|1079|For while they to their sure destruction ride,

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|31|paragraph|1081|My Very Self, comes hastening to man’s aid

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|33|paragraph|1083|To build My Kingdom on the ruined plan 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|34|paragraph|1084|For power which those rabid wolves have made.

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|36|paragraph|1086|And make each tyrant totter on his throne.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|37|paragraph|1087|Look! Even now have they not sternly hurled 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|38|paragraph|1088|A horde of them unto their doom! Now prone 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|39|paragraph|1089|They lie who late their filthy dunghill strode 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|40|paragraph|1090|And blatantly their barnyard triumph crowed.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|41|paragraph|1091|For all such cocks the last dread hour hath struck. 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|42|paragraph|1092|The vengeance of My marching Hosts shall pluck 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|43|paragraph|1093|Them from their seats. Among forgotten things 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|44|paragraph|1094|Soon - Soon shall they be numbered. Look! Their wings
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|45|paragraph|1095|Have now been clipped: they speedily shall fall 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|46|paragraph|1096|Into the pit they for their brothers dug 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|47|paragraph|1097|And none shall hark nor heed their dying call.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|18|section|1098|Man Speaks:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|1099|THY HOSTS! Thy Hosts triumphant? Who are these,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|2|paragraph|1100|O God! I see tnem not. The tyrant seems 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|1101|Triumphant: When one falls his vacant place 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|1102|Is taken by another worse than he.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|1103|How canst Thou let such huge injustice be!
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|1104|In vain man dreams of his long-sought release 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|1105|From slavery to arrogance. His dreams 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|1106|Of liberty and truth across the face 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|1107|Of History float like a wraith. It seems 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|1108|That warfare triumphs, not Thy promised Peace;
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|1109|Of brotherhood sincere there’s scarce a trace.

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|1113|And rise to serve My Everlasting Truth.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|1114|Each one of them holds in his righteous hand 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|1115|A trumpet, sounding loudly in each land 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|1116|The call to free and more abundant life.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|1117|These walk above the world by My Great Name, 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|1118|And, like a searing, devastating flame 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|1119|Destroy- the forts of wrong and still man’s strife.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|1120|From every human attribute set free
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|1121|They take commands from Me - from only Me!
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|1122|See how the shadow moveth when its lord,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|13|paragraph|1123|The sun, commands. So do My servants stand 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|1124|And move, and raze and build at My Command. 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|15|paragraph|1125|These rule the world with Justice, My Keen Sword.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|16|paragraph|1126|My attributes adorn their earthly frame;
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|17|paragraph|1127|Their very names are lost in My Great Name;
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|18|paragraph|1128|Their brows illumined with My Holiness 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|19|paragraph|1129|They singing march all evil to redress.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|20|paragraph|1130|So hath My Love their total being won:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|21|paragraph|1131|So hath It through their veins and arteries run,
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|22|paragraph|1132|That every part and limb obeys My Voice:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|23|paragraph|1133|They can no other for they’ve made their choice.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|24|paragraph|1134|When once My servants listen unto Me 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|25|paragraph|1135|They hear none else, for they at last are free 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|26|paragraph|1136|From all dependence on men’s praise or blame.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|27|paragraph|1137|My smile their glory is, My frown their shame.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|28|paragraph|1138|My Power assists them: one alone pursues 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|29|paragraph|1139|A thousand and ten times that number flee

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|32|paragraph|1142|The chains of slaves, the bars of prisons greet 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|33|paragraph|1143|Their shouts and vanish when they sound the knell.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|34|paragraph|1144|Such are My Hosts. They have bound up their thews 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|35|paragraph|1145|With My all-conquering Omnipotence.

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|21|section|1151|God Speaks:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|1|paragraph|1152|HAST NEVER heard this parable? Two sons

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|3|paragraph|1154|One said: "I go,” but went not, while the other 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|4|paragraph|1155|Refused to go, but later did repent 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|5|paragraph|1156|And on the mission of his father went.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|6|paragraph|1157|Which of these two was of the faithful ones?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|7|paragraph|1158|The wordy one or his repentant brother?
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|8|paragraph|1159|Or hast thou never heard ’twas said of old:
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|9|paragraph|1160|"He that is not against Me is enrolled 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|10|paragraph|1161|Beneath My Banner?”
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|11|paragraph|1162|Now, at last, the Day 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|12|paragraph|1163|So long awaited hath appeared. The scroll 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|13|paragraph|1164|Of the dead past in now rolled up, and soon 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|14|paragraph|1165|A New World Order shall arise. Behold -

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|29|paragraph|1180|That she may fly with man on equal wing.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|30|paragraph|1181|One language must he learn to speak, that so 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|31|paragraph|1182|The winds of vague distrust may cease to blow.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|32|paragraph|1183|He must to all details of life apply 
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|33|paragraph|1184|The Law of Love. Thus all his social needs

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|35|paragraph|1186|Of hatred, born of envy, quickly die.

Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|45|paragraph|1196|Must nevermore upon My children frown.
Bahá’í|Howard Colby Ives|The Song Celestial|46|paragraph|1197|Man must upon My Singleness agree;
